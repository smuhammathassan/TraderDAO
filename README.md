In this project, the goal was to make a DAO that buys NFT for the community and it is done based on voting.  
There are following constraints from the client. 

- Just make sure that the proposer is a member of the DAO. 
- In order to enter the DAO you must first transfer your NFTs to the DAO. 
- Number of submitted NFTs is equal to the voting power.
- Only members of the DAO can propose a proposal to buy the dao. 
- sc will check if the proposed NFT to buy is on sale?
- sc will check if the dao has enough money to buy the NFT?
- If both conditions are met then the proposal will be presented in front of the community to vote. 
- minimum of 60% of members' input is required to pass the vote. 
- based on voting results DAO will buy or not buy it. 
- if the proposal is passed then it will buy it. 
- hold it for a certain period of time or if it gets a better offer that is more than 100% of the initial price it will sell it. 
- distribute the earnings among the member of the dao who voted and who didn't vote but were members and are still members with a 2:1 ratio.
